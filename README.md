## 🎉 Final Notes

This is **not** a get-rich-quick scheme. It's a real business that requires:
- 2 hours initial setup
- 1 hour/week maintenance
- Active marketing (especially first month)
- Customer support

But it's designed to be as automated as possible while still being profitable.

**Your job:**
1. Set it up once (2 hours)
2. Market it actively (first month)
3. Support customers (ongoing)
4. Watch it grow

Good luck! 🚀
